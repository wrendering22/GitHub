    <ins> <b>Personal Statement. (About the artist)</b> </ins> <br> <br>

Wren is a London based artist who primarily creates community art with interactive elements to encourage engagement in collaborative and creative social events.
Wren’s work is politically engaged and revolves around the following fundamental notions: <br>
<ul>
<li>Art is the act of making or producing something when an individual or collective owns their own factor of production. In other words, art is the process of buying materials or resources and dictating what you do with them.</li>
<li>An object produced in this manner is only ‘art’ if the maker would do it for no monetary incentive.</li>
</ul>
These two fundamental ideas are not revolutionary nor in any way new, but they suggest that the incentive for making or producing art sits outside the incentives presumed for production within capitalism.
Wren believes that the value of art is more likely to define a social value as opposed to a monetary incentive, they therefore believe that opportunities to engage with art will hold that same social value when implemented across a community.

Wren makes work in and for a community, you can see upcoming projects in the FUTURE PROJECTS HUB (found on the main page). The hub contains posters and information about upcoming projects as well as information on how to run a similar incentive for your community including: what skills would be required, safety advice, space requirements, rough cost estimates and timing guides. All posters are available to download and use as your own to advertise your next community get together.
<br><br>
Wren continues to develop their own practice to feed into the work they make for the community, and although most of this work will inevitably remain private, they have taken part in exhibitions and events across london which you can see below in the ‘selected exhibitions and events’ section..<br>
