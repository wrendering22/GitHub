    <i>A series of slots lower up to four round acetate slides onto individual motors. The motors are controlled by participants who are able to set the speed and direction in which the slides rotate. Together they form a collective image. The event also included an acetate wall to preview how light would interact with mediums before engaging with a slide, and although this was meant to be a preliminary step, many were happy enough experimenting with this wall.</i>

    This project was made for my local community with the intention of creating a social event to bring the community together.
    Participants explored personal themes from family and cultural heritage to sexual identity and personal symbolism.
