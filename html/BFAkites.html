    Sometimes I have an idea that feels like it would somehow unlock a part of my identity and I just need to do it to understand what that is as such.<br>
    In 2019 I made a boat out of rubbish, which I talk about in more depth in the main options page, but It kind of confirmed the truth in this feeling and since this project I have taken this sensation a lot more seriously. <br>
    At the start of lockdown I built a contraption that I hoped would help me fly using only the power of kites. Essentially the more surface area to catch a strong wind, the more lifting power, but its quite hard to get a steady current of air lower to the ground. Often when I sent a large kite up it would only really catch the hectic lower currents and drag me everywhere but upwards. I essentially needed the larger kite to experience no wind until it had got well into the higher skies. This is where I came up with the idea to use a curtain like system. The kites frame would be lifted into higher altitude by a smaller kite which couldn't drag me about anywhere in the lower currents and when it was high enough I would pull a cord and the curtains would be pulled shut over the frame creating a large kite. <br>
    I had made countless prototypes but managed to fly a larger version around mid 2021 using a large wind machine, the kind you would use for the inflatable ‘wacky waving’ men. The invention worked incredibly well but I unfortunately had not installed any sort of directional control so it got quite out of control and smashed, since then I never revisited the project.<br>
    In 2022 I started working with communities and due to the level of research I had made into kites, using NASA calculations and running countless test kites, I thought it would be a valuable activity to share with the community.<br>
    Kites carry with them an enormous power to display something for all to see whilst also opening up dialogue with other kite makers and flyers around you. They can be an incredible tool to amplify the voices of those often overlooked while also giving people the chance to connect and build local culture. The kites seen here are from an ongoing project to make kites to fly together in the summer.<br>
