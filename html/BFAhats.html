    <ins> <b>Hat Party</b> </ins> <br> <br>

    In November of 2019, I hosted a small hat party, for which I made 25 paper mache hats, ranging from bucket and cap to beret and top hat with cowboy being the crowd favourite.<br>
    The hats were hooked onto strings attached to the ceiling so that they dangled at various headheights, participants were able to unhook them and decorate how they wished before hooking them back up and slipping their heads into the different hats everyone had made. <br>
    The project was one of the first community projects I had actually organised and to my surprise it went down really well, most people would end up keeping their hats and the remainder are proudly displayed in my house.
