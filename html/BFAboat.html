    <ins> <b>The Boat</b> </ins> <br> <br>

    In 2019 I started collecting materials from the objects that people left out on the side of the road. Gradually over the course of about 5 months I would construct a boat out of crates, bookshelves, bedframes, boilers and old letting agents sign posts.<br>
    After I had assembled a raft like structure I filled all the gaps and began applying waterproofing.<br>
    My plan was to walk it 3 and a half miles to the tottenham reservoir where I knew a bylaw enabled me to sail homemade boats without a licence. Unfortunately I only made it halfway before injuring my back, forcing me to turn back towards home. I got it home and ended up in A and E with some sort of ripped muscle in my back.<br>
    Sewage erupted in my house and I was forced to move out, with that I had to disassemble the boat and return each piece to where it had come from. <br>
    I think it is possibly the most meaningful piece of work I have ever done for myself. I love the fantastical desire to roam the rivers at night and watch my sail cut through the darkness in subtle tones of blue, I love that I half expected to sail out of london for a few days, I think these unrealistic expectations were what made me make a boat in the first place and are just as much the piece as any of the rest of it. I love that I poured 5 months of hard labour into this vessel that would inevitably peak in this form of a boat and then return without trace to the same skipps I had fished them out of a few months earlier.<br>
    Ultimately I think the sensation I experienced before, during and after this project is what inspired me to start working with a community, art can have such an impact on how we understand ourselves and for me this was a big turning point in how I would understand myself.<br><br>
    One day I am going to live closer to water and I am going to do this again.
